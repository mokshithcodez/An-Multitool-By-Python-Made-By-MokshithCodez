# 🌟 Mokshith Codez's Multitool Project 🌟

Hello, I am Mokshith Codez, and I am 13 years old. 🎉 This is my first Python project, and I am excited to share it with you! It's a simple multitool with some cool features that can help with tasks like generating passwords 🔑, playing songs 🎶, and more!

## ✨ Features ✨

- **Password Generator 🔐**: Creates strong and random passwords to keep your accounts safe.
- **Number Guessing Game 🎮**: A fun game where you guess a random number.
- **Random Song 🎵**: Get a surprise song every time!
- **Wikipedia Search Engine 🌐**: Quickly search for information on Wikipedia.
- **Text to Speech 🗣️**: Converts text into speech and lets you hear it.
- **Exit 🚪**: Exit the tool when you're done using it.

## ⚙️ Installation ⚙️

To get started with the multitool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MokshithCodez/multitool.git
Install the required libraries 📦:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyttsx3 wikipedia webbrowser
Run the program ▶️:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
💡 How It Works 💡
This multitool allows users to choose from different options such as generating passwords 🔑, playing a game 🎮, or converting text to speech 🗣️. Once the program is run, it will ask the user to select one of the features from a list, and the tool will execute the selected task.

🚀 Why I Created This Project 🚀
I created this tool as a beginner project to practice Python programming 🐍. It combines different skills like working with functions, loops, and libraries, and it's my way of learning how to make useful tools 💻.
