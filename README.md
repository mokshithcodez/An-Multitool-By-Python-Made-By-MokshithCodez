    <h1>🌟 Mokshith Codez's Multitool Project 🌟</h1>

    <p>Hello, I am Mokshith Codez, and I am 13 years old. 🎉 This is my first Python project, and I am excited to share it with you! It's a simple multitool with some cool features that can help with tasks like generating passwords 🔑, playing songs 🎶, and more!</p>

    <h2>✨ Features ✨</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Password Generator 🔐:</strong> Creates strong and random passwords to keep your accounts safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Number Guessing Game 🎮:</strong> A fun game where you guess a random number.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Song 🎵:</strong> Get a surprise song every time!</li>
        <li><strong>Wikipedia Search Engine 🌐:</strong> Quickly search for information on Wikipedia.</li>
        <li><strong>Text to Speech 🗣️:</strong> Converts text into speech and lets you hear it.</li>
        <li><strong>Exit 🚪:</strong> Exit the tool when you're done using it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ Installation ⚙️</h2>
    <p>To get started with the multitool, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clone the repository:</strong>  
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MokshithCodez/multitool.git</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Install the required libraries 📦:</strong>  
            <pre><code>pip install pyttsx3 wikipedia webbrowser</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Run the program ▶️:</strong>  
            <pre><code>python main.py</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>💡 How It Works 💡</h2>
    <p>This multitool allows users to choose from different options such as generating passwords 🔑, playing a game 🎮, or converting text to speech 🗣️. Once the program is run, it will ask the user to select one of the features from a list, and the tool will execute the selected task.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Why I Created This Project 🚀</h2>
    <p>I created this tool as a beginner project to practice Python programming 🐍. It combines different skills like working with functions, loops, and libraries, and it's my way of learning how to make useful tools 💻.</p>
